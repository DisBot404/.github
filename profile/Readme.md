**TKMM**, (**T**ears of the **K**ingdom **M**od **M**anager) is a mod packager and merger. TKMM automatically takes modded game files and generates bite-sized changelogs for important mod assets (like BYML files, GameDataList, and RSDB) and packages them (along with all other mod assets, like models and textures) into a single archive. A series of those archives can then be merged and combined, in order of preferred priority, into a single mod folder, ready to be loaded into the game.

TKMM smartly combines your mods and maximizes the likelihood that your game will load with all of your favorites ready to go.
