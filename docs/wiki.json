        "Description": "When packaging a TKCL (Mod Archive), modders have the option to package their mod with sub-packages containing extra content. Mod options have priority over the main TKCL file, for example: If the base of a mod edits Alb1.txtg, but an option also edits Alb1.txtg, the options edit will be the one included upon merging. Options can be mandatory, optional (singular or multi select), and options can be reliant upon each other."
