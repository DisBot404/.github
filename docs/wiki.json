        "Description": "When packaging a TCL, mod creators can give their mod 'Options'. These options are different configurations of files that the mod user can customize to better tailor their experience. Options come in two styles; single- and multi-select. Single-select option sets require the user to pick exactly one of the mod options. Multi-select option sets allow the user to choose however many of the options in the set they would like. A TCL can have as many option sets as the mod creator would like to add. To give your mod option sets, click the 'Include Options' box, and you will be presented with the ability to add option sets, select the type of option set, and add mods to the option sets you've created."
